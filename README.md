# Video Subtitle Generator

This is a simple application that automatically adds subtitles to a video in the specified language using Go, Fiber, and Python. It utilizes the OpenaAI's Whisper system for transcription and LibreTranslate for translation. I completed this within one day.

- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [Fiber](https://docs.gofiber.io/guide/getting-started)
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Whisper ASR](https://whisper.a-i.com/docs/)
- [LibreTranslate](https://libretranslate.com/docs/)

2. Install Go dependencies:

    ```bash
    go get -d ./...
    ```

3. It will automatically create a Python virtual environment and packages that needed.

## Usage

1. Place the video file you want to add subtitles to in the project directory.

4. Upload your video file, select the target language for subtitles, and click the "Generate Subtitles" button.

5. The application will process the video, transcribe the audio using Whisper, translate the transcription using LibreTranslate, and then generate subtitles.
